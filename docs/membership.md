# Membership

DaalBeat requires all users to sign up, mint DAAL Token, and get KYC verified. The onboarding process prevents fraudsters and protects every user as they participate in the protocol.

## Step 1: User Signup

All users are required to sign up with their email and password. We will open up more social logins as well soon.

## Step 2: DAAL Token

DAAL token is a membership NFT Token. The NFT token gives access to all DaalBeatâ€™s features and discord community. In order to create or join the healthcare emergency fund DAO, you are required to own a DAAL NFT Token.

## Step 3: KYC Verification

Since there are financial transactions between users, we require KYC from each user.
