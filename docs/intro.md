## What DaalBeat Is

DaalBeat is a healthcare toolkit on the blockchain. The protocol provides an open-source API for healthcare pricing (OpenHP API) through the decentralized subgraphs (<a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">The Graph Protocol</a>) and a healthcare emergency fund (HEF) micro DAO network on permissionless blockchains. It implements proof of transparency in reaching consensus mechanisms for the public to facilitate the transfer of funds, distribution, and validation of healthcare pricing information.

## What DaalBeat Is Not

- Health/Medical Insurance
